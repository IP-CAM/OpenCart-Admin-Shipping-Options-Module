This project was created to allow for the user to update shipping options in the admin after an order has been submitted. The administrator may add and remove products and the shipping cost will be updated based on the sum of the product weight.  The method of delivery can also be updated.  Once shipping has been updated the order may be processed through the backend.  

The client needed the changes because orders need to be reviewed prior to the customer being charged.

These are modifications to the OpenCart shopping cart.

Dependencies:
*QPhoric's FedEx Live Rates module
*Authorize.net (AIM) extension
*You will need to change the authorize.net method to authorize only, so that payments may be processed from the admin
